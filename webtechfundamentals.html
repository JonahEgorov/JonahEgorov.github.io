                    <p>Introduction to the Web</p>
                    <p>It is important to understand how the web works and have a concrete understanding of why you do what you do. Internet net is a term of a massive network of millions of computers.  Including email SMS messaging. WEB is way of transmitting data over the internet. The WEB is interaction between clients and servers. A request for content is made to that server. When browser makes a request uses a URL to locate requested content. Which is passed onto a DNS which translates the URL into an IP address. The browser than uses this IP address. Dynamic sites must first be processed by web applications. DNS is one of the most important processes on the web. It is important to make sure DNS is registered properly. The internet relies on tons of computers working together. Protocols are simple languages that let one computer share data with another. Transmission Control Protocol. This is the backbone of the internet. The internet uses multiple layers of protocols. The internet needs these protocols to work. HTTP hypertext transfer Protocol. URL is short for uniform resource locater. Http is the protocol. Resource name. Www. is sub domain .lynda is domain .com is top level domain. Sub DOmain is a folder that web content is located in. Understanding how URls work is important. Knowing what is going on inside the browser is very important. Browsers use HTTP to communicate with web serves and to access content. Rendering engines are still being updated. Web Standards has a good advantages.www.webstandards.org . Understanding web standards by learning those standards can insure they have consistent design. Some basic server concepts needed to be understood. Web servers are computers with some special software. Dedicated plans usually cost more money. Web Servers have to process data. Web Stack contains OS web server database server and programming language. LAMP stack linux is OS Apache is web server MySQl is database server and PHP is programming language. Web Server needs to process the pages. </p>
                    <p>Front-end Technology</p>
                    <p>t web developers refer to themselves as front end developer’s. Front end is the visual layer usually the UI. The UI and the layout. The most common languages are HTMl CSS and javascript. The most common languages are HTML CSS and Javascript. Lots of development is being done within the browser using powerful javascript libraries. Some terms overlap. Front end designers are more visual designers. Creating mockups, structured semantic content, and handling site accessibility. There is a lot more to this list. And some specialize in different areas. Explore all the various areas so you have a broader understanding of how all the various technologies and how they work together. HTMl is the language of the web. HTML is super important every web page is coded in it.  HTML 2 was a “standard”. Some history threatened the security of HTML. XHTML was meant to move it to a more structured based approach. A really structured language only. HTML 5 beat out XHTML2  WHATWG to continue the development of HTML. HTML contains backwards compatibility. HTMl uses tags to structure docs and give things new meanings. Learning HTMl is learning the syntax of the language and the basic structure. It is incredibly easy to learn. Doctype html. It says what version of HTML it is using. You need 2 slices of bread. You need to have opening and closing html tags. Head of the document. The head contains not visually elements that make HTMl necessary. Body tag is the meat of the sandwich. The visual elements are contained in the body tags. If it is visual element it needs to be in order in the body tag. Learn basic structure will make you well on your way to write clean valid HTML. CSS is the stylesheet for HTML. Cascade refers to how the style is applied to the pages. The styles are allowed to overwrite one another. HTMl is not very attractive. You can use one file for all of your code.. CSS is just a collection of different types of rules. And they pass along properties. The selector and the declaration. What font and what size to make text? Separated by colons and semicolons to tell it that it is done. CSS brings to web design highly modular design. CSS is an essential skill for any web designer. 
                    Modern Web design relies on Scripting languages. Javascript is not related to Java. Javascript allows designers to create interactive elements. Can open new windows or give users feedback. Can update data. Javascript frameworks are libraries with pre built interactive widgets. Learn the basics of javascript then look into frameworks. JPG GIF PNG SVG.  SVGs are vector format. API Application Programming INterfaces.  A set of instructions and standards for accessing services or components of a specific system.  Websites can use the power of larger websites to go far beyond their current capabilities.  Research what a site’s API will allow me to integrate into my site. If APIs change the service can no longer work. There are great APIs that aren’t specific to a certain company. HTMl5 was created to let users use it without plug ins. WHATWG developed HTML5. It is very important to understand APIs. Web FOnts allow you to use fonts people may not have on their computer. </p>
                    <p>Back-end technology</p>
                    <p>Any scripting that runs on a server is referred to as Server Side Scripting. Server Side Scripting has evolved a lot since it’s release. The scripts themselves are hidden from the end user. It places the burden of running the Site Scripting on the server. This is the reason Client Side scripting is becoming so popular. Learn how JAvascript is being used for more powerful client side scripting. PHP is a powerful server side processing language. Using open source software anyone could set up a free server. To the end user the PHP code itself is invisible. It tells the webs server it needs processing done before it is displayed in the browser. PHP code is processed on the server. The PHP looks like HTML now. You need a server to see PHP. PHP is relatively easy to learn with lots of resources. Java Server Pages is powerful tool developed by sun. JSP has a steeper learning curve. .NET is name used by microsoft to refer to it’s entire framework. .NET must be hosted on a windows server. Coldfusion uses it’s own markup language. Coldfusion server is not free. Although pricing structure has dropped dramatically over the years. Python is open source. RUby is another powerful language. </p>
                     <p>Assembly Technologies</p>
                    <p>HTMl, CSS and JAvascript are the three core technologies to build anything online.  Assembly technologies have been created to reduce time. Javascript libraries extend the javascript language. jQuery has a broader focus, you must include link to it in page. There are pre built collections that pack HTML and can be referred to frameworks and boilerplates. Collection of prebuilt CSS, HTML, and JAvascript files designed to speed development of issues.  Boiler PLates are a set of templates built to focus around a very specific standard or goal.. Frameworks on the other hand are more of a collection of assets that provide a system for building sites. CSS Preprocessor is a scripting language that allows you to extend CSS with new syntax. Using a preprocessor is a two step process. There are multiple ways to drive a preprocessor site. They can add additional technology. They make it more efficient and they help deal with browser inconsistencies. Sass and less are CSS preprocessors.  </p>
