                    <p>Getting Started
                    Front end developers develop languages that render in the browser, primarily html, css and javascript. Some sites require special server. That kind of development is called back end developer. People who use the full stack are called full stack developer.  Hyper Text Markup Language. Information Architecture is the structural design of a website. All web developers are masters of mark up language. Front End developer must enjoy correcting code. (Take HTML essential Training) </p>

                    <p>Design is very important. UX is user experience. Cascading Style Sheets is CSS.  CSS ZEn Garden shows how same content can look completely different. CSS has similar features to programming languages. (CSS Core Concepts) Javascript is pretty essential to web development. Debug in Javascript can be very frustrating. Workflow tools can be very helpful. (Foundations of programming). </p>

                    <p>Must use database to manage the flow to the user(foundations of programming databases). THe web stack a company uses is vastly different. (PHP with SQL). Servers send the information to your computer. Server is in charge of managing the interaction between data and how it interacts with the user. Linux is more common and less experience. Linux is fully open source. IT can be helpful to understand. BUilding a website with Node.js. Server Side Scripting is code that runs on the server and converts it into information that the browser can display. PHP .net Node.js ruby and python. Start with PHP, they speed up working with larger websites.  Relational Database Management system. This works by creating tables that create relationships between the data. There are many ways to do similar things. Different companies choose different things. (Aguilar jS 1 building a data driven app) </p>
                    
                    <p>Learning and Training: 
                    There are four paths people take. Instruction Led, Self study, making mistakes actually makes you a stronger developer improving your ability to test. Your education never really ends. College degrees are very helpful. Most jobs require college degrees. Developer’s have the highest average salary. It teaches to think and study by themselves. Math and physics courses are important to developments. Coding boot camps teach the necessary skill. COurses are 9-12 weeks long. Many camps run 40 hours or more per week. They teach skills not often taught in school. Bootcamps choose hardly very many people. ONly 50% of college graduates have jobs that relate to their degree. Bootcamps are great for people will a solid edutactional background. Slack is useful. Stack Overflow is a wonderful tool. Ebooks can be very usable. GitHUb can be very helpful with allows you to create a new version of an existing project. </p>

                    <p>It is important to make contacts with the industry. Most developers got their job because of a friend's referral. You should contribute in some way at meetings. Social Learning opportunities are very important. Be genuine at events that interest you. Tools like programming languages change all the time. Learn the editor IDE and text editors. Popular IDE’s Visual Studio, eclipse, netbeans, and android studios. Text Editors load faster but take longer to edit. Atom. Terminal is very important. CLI command line interfaces. (Learn the linux command line the basics.). Learn to master browsers. (Javascript enhancing the DOM) Every developer who works with these tools can build any site. PHP myAdmin is the default with most server providers. (Up and running with PHP myAdmin) Version Control most popular system is called git. Learn some frameworks. Libraries of pre built code that help you build code faster. Bootstrap and JQuery. (WordPress essential Training) Sites have accessibility. (FOundations of UX accessibility.)  Agile Project is very important. 96% of developer’s say they work on a development team. It is important to get different perspectives. (connecting with peers in the workplace). Present and defend your ideas. (Negotiating Salary). </p>
                    <p>Getting a Job: 
                    A true full stack developer is a unicorn and fewer have jobs that identify as front end or back end developers. Most developers are interested in learning new opportunities. Quality of people you work with and working on project meaningful to you is an important factor. The more talented you are the easier it will be to find work that is competitive. Developer’s with more experience make more money than new developer’s. Education can make a big difference in terms of salary. A few years of experience pays off big. The best way to get a job is through a referral, one of the reasons you needs to interact with other developer’s. Learning how to work with recruiters is good. Try to connect with people inside the company, don’t be afraid to use social media. (Job hunting online). The development industry is surprisingly social.
