                    <p>Utilizing best SEO Practices</p>
                    <p>Do not have duplicate content. It is bad for the same content. It could lead to being counted as SPAM in google and blacklisted. Make sure the tab at top is different. Write clear and unique page titles for each product page on the site. Don’t copy and paste the manufacture of the product description page into your site. You can tell the Search Engine where the content come from. Make sure to tell google which page is original. Keyword Density refers to total number of keywords divided by words on the page. Make sure the keyword words are more natural. Cloaking Text is not very good idea. Avoid the practice at all cost. The key to keywords is using them naturally.

                    <p>Try to find a domain name that relates to their industry. Like musethemes.com Three is the maximum to have for you url. Avoid top level domains. .cc .info and .bc can trigger spam filters. Make the url so people can hear it and know how to spell it. Use hyphens scarcely. Shorter is better. Use only one hyphen max and only if required. Your home page should explain what your page is about. Focus only on benefits. Encourage deeper exploration. Make it clear what you do or sell. Make sure the important stuff is above the fold. Keep the page light and easy to skim. Match the tone with the design and user. Storefront needs to be friendly and approachable.   Having Mobile Accessibility will really help if they are on mobile.  Mobile friendly testing tool is important. There is a google tool to test if it is mobile friendly. Responsive design is important. It will show what the mobile website looks like. Design with mobile usability in design. Average size is font size is 17px. </p>
