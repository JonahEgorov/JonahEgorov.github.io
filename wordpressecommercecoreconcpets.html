                                        <p>Understanding your Market:</p>
                    <p>Choose a business model before you choose a platform. Choose an area of interest. Choose a Product. Physical or Virtual. Virtual Products books, software, or membership to a website. You can sell products with affiliate marketing. You need to look at your audience. Try to look at it from your customer’s point of view?  Create Personas. Focus on just one of your personas.  MAke sure to organize your products.  There are various forms. Gravity Forms has a fixed cost and all in one. Ninja Forms pay A la Carte Low cost for few services. Gravity Forms works very well for developers.  You can sell add ons for your products.  Add ons will be great at selling more stuff.  Subscriptions should be convenient.  Crowdfunding is a great way to see if there is interest. </p>

                    <p>Marketing your Site:</p>
                    <p>You have to use marketing to get traffic. Usually invest time or money or both. Advertising is quick results it has many options. There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to advertising. Downside of advertising means you have to spend money to get people to your site. SEO is very important to ecommerce. Content Marketing is a slow process. Social Media is a great way to share your message. It is about building and maintaining your relationships. Cost of acquisition the money and effort you get people to your site. No effort = no traffic. CoA and CLV. Lower CoA and increase CLV. CoA < CLV is good. Return customers with encouragement and other items. Subscription services are very good ideas. Newsletters and Social Media is a great way to maintain contact with your customers. Try to get your customers to order more per visit. Have a premium version of your product. BUndling a package very well is a great way to make people buy stuff.  Upselling encourages someone to buy a more expensive version of the same product.  Cross Sell encourage someone to buy a related product. Offer free shipping for a higher price purchase. </p>
                    <p>Selling Products:</p>
                    <p>You need website, payment gateway, merchant account, and bank account for your business. Payment Gateway checks to see if funds are available. Modern gateways are pretty good for an online only store. Anything involving credit cards requires extra security. ONly capture a charge when you ship out the product. Examine your needs when it comes to checking out. PayPal is safer than credit cards. Let them checkout through amazon. Stripe is pretty powerful.  Do you need recurring payments. Most gateways don’t let you do recurring gateway payments. Stripe is a great way to use credit cards.</p>
                    <p>Shipping, Orders, and Taxes:</p>
                    <p>Make sure to use software with more shipping options. Free shipping is a great way to get more people to spend more. Estimates get a quote directly from USPS, FedEx or other providers. YOu need to set up a free account or a time consuming account. You need to manage orders a lot. You can manage roles so you can have someone with certain status. You can print labels at home. Refunding can be a bit tricky. Make sure you get a gateway that works for you.  Have your products on both sites. There is a lot of software for your various needs. Such as Ship Station do all you're shipping in one place. Make sure you have everything you need. But don’t pay for something you don’t need. Taxes vary on your location. There are a lot of programs that help with these things. Consult tax professional. </p>
                    <p>Securing Your Site:</p>
                    <p>Security is so important. Held financially liable, lose customers trust. Having a secure looking site increases sales. Unsecured traffic can be intercepted if you're on a site that . YOu need an SSl certificate for your website. COnsider customer security even if you dont collect credit cards on your site. PCI DSS Compliance. Easier and safer to have an off site gateway. You need to force users to use SSL. Outline a security plan for your site. </p>
                    <p>Using Wordpress for Ecommerce:</p>
                    <p>Use a platform on wordpress if you want a entire store. Open source is the best way to go when you're using a site.  Easydigitaldownloads is great for selling digital goods. WP eCommerce is another one. Who makes the plugin is important.  Hosted Platform gives you less control. They require less oversight on your part. SSL certificate. Downside of Gumroad, there are no carts, you can only buy one product at a time. Clickbank handles all the management stuff. Affiliate payments are on the site. Shopify is well known and respected in the sphere,doesn't even require wordpress. </p>
                    <p>Testing and Optimization:</p>
                    <p>Make sure you test your site. The most important thing to check is the checkout process. Make sure they don’t cache data. Try different browsers. Test shipping methods. Test each product. Set up test accounts and test each of them. Test anything unique to your site. Make sure users can view the right content. Small errors can cause major headaches down the road. make sure you optimize your site. Everything can be optimized. Install an analytics tool. Refer to SEO with eCommerce on Lynda.com </p>
